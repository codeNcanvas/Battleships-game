# ⚓ Battleship (Java)

**Battleship** is a command-line version of the classic strategy game where the player attempts to sink hidden enemy ships. Implemented in Java using Object-Oriented Programming principles, this project is great for beginners learning logic, arrays, classes, and simple user input handling.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. The game hides 3 "startups" (ships) on a 7×7 grid.
2. You guess locations like `a1`, `b3`, etc.
3. The game responds with:
   - `miss` – no ship at that spot.
   - `hit` – you've hit a ship!
   - `kill` – you've sunk an entire ship.
4. Your goal is to sink all startups in as few guesses as possible.
